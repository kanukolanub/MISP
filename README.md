# MISP

## Overview

This repository contains a project on how to create an event based on an investigation of Emotet Epoch 4 infection with Cobalt Strike and Spambot from malware-traffic-analysis.net.

**Event Management**
The Event Actions tab is where you, as an analyst, will create all malware investigation correlations by providing descriptions and attributes associated with the investigation. Splitting the process into three significant phases, we have: 

* Event Creation.
* Populating events with attributes and attachments.
* Publishing.
